iPhone app showing water fountains around SF

The app displays a map with a static list of pin annotations representing water fountains around San Francisco.  This is valuable information for runners or other users engaged in outdoor exercise to be able to access from a mobile app.

The user can see the list of fountains in either a map view or a list view.  A single fountain can be viewed in detail, which displays comments on the fountain that the user can edit.

The app is written so that it would be easy to add functionality for users to add fountains to the map themselves - this is the ultimate goal and would make for a much more useful app.  Other logical extensions would be to show the user's location on the map, to show how far each fountain was from the user at any point in time, or give the user the ability to add other features to the map besides water fountains - bathrooms, good rest stops, etc.
